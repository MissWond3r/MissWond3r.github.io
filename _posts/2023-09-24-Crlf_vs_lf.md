Imagine you're working on a project with a friend. You're both writing a story, but you live in different countries, and each country has its own way of starting a new line in a document.

In your country, when you start a new line, you use a special symbol, let's call it "X"
In your friend's country, they use a different symbol, let's call it "Y" to start a new line.
Now, let's say you want to work on the story together, so you share it using a tool that combines both of your work. However, this tool doesn't understand your country's "X" and your friend's country's "Y" very well. **It gets confused.**

In the world of software development, even the simplest-looking characters can hide complexities. One such seemingly innocuous pair is the line endings used in text files: CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) and LF (Line Feed). Understanding these line endings and their implications, especially in the context of Git and .NET development, can save you from unexpected issues down the road.

___________________________
**WHAT ARE LINE ENDINGS?**

Line endings are characters or sequences of characters that mark the end of a line in a text file. They have been a source of subtle cross-platform compatibility issues for decades. Here are the two main types:


-*CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed)*: In CRLF, a line ending consists of two characters: Carriage Return (CR) followed by Line Feed (LF).
Windows operating systems traditionally use CRLF line endings.


-*LF (Line Feed)*: In LF, a line ending consists of a single character: Line Feed (LF). Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) and most developers prefer LF line endings.
__________________________
**THE GIT LINE ENDING DILEMMA**

Git, the version control system used by millions of developers worldwide, has its own preference when it comes to line endings. It's important to understand how Git handles line endings to avoid unintended consequences.

Git allows you to configure how line endings should be treated using **.gitattributes**, **core.autocrlf** and **core.eol** settings in your Git configuration.

-*core.autocrlf*: If set to true, Git will automatically convert LF line endings to CRLF on checkout and convert CRLF to LF on commit when working on Windows.
If set to input, Git will not perform any line ending conversion on commit or checkout.
On Unix-based systems, this setting is usually set to input.

-*core.eol*: Specifies the line ending style to use for files, regardless of the operating system. Values can be lf, crlf, or native.

**.NET AND CRLF**

Now, let's talk about the .NET development community. While most developers prefer LF line endings, .NET development, particularly in older versions, has often used CRLF as the default line ending style.

This can lead to complications using Git. Mixing CRLF and LF line endings can result in inconsistent code, merge conflicts, and version control headaches.

**BEST PRACTICES**

To avoid line ending conflicts and ensure cross-platform compatibility in your .NET projects, consider the following best practices:

-*Use LF Line Endings for New Projects*:

If you're starting a new .NET project, consider adopting LF line endings from the beginning. In case you are not in .NET, make sure to use LF if you want to avoid most of the problems that come with CRLF.

-*Configure Git Properly*:

Set core.autocrlf to true if you're on Windows.
Ensure your .gitattributes file specifies line endings appropriately.

-*Educate Your Team*:

Make sure your development team is aware of the importance of line endings and follows consistent practices.

-*Check Your Dependencies*:

Be aware of any third-party libraries or tools that might introduce line ending issues and plan accordingly.
