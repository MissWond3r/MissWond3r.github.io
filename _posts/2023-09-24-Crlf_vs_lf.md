Imagine you're working on a project with a friend. You're both writing a story, but you live in different countries, and each country has its own way of starting a new line in a document.

In your country, when you start a new line, you use a special symbol, let's call it "X"
In your friend's country, they use a different symbol, let's call it "Y" to start a new line.
Now, let's say you want to work on the story together, so you share it using a tool that combines both of your work. However, this tool doesn't understand your country's "X" and your friend's country's "Y" very well. **It gets confused.**

This is similar to what happens with Git and CRLF (Carriage Return, Line Feed) line endings. Git tries to combine code written by developers from different countries or using different operating systems. When it sees those different line endings (CRLF or LF), it can get confused and think there are changes in the text when there really aren't.

To make Git happy and avoid these misunderstandings, you and your friend would need to agree on a common symbol to start new lines (let's call it "Z"), and both of you would use "Z" in your story. This way, when you combine your work, there are no surprises, and everything goes smoothly.

In the Git world, developers configure Git to use a consistent line-ending symbol (either CRLF or LF) for their project to prevent these confusions
