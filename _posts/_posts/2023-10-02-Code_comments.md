Code comments serve as a double-edged sword. 
On one hand, they can be invaluable for documenting code and helping developers understand intricate logic.
On the other hand, excessive comments can clutter code, making it harder to maintain and comprehend.

Instead of relying on comments to explain every line of code, aim to write code that is self-documenting. For example, avoid using variable names like VAR1, VAR, ELEMENT...
Instead, use names that specifically refer to what they represent: PERSON, AGE, ID...

We are going to use **only** two types of comments: "TODO" and "FIXME".

**THE PROBLEM WITH EXCESSIVE COMMENTS**

-*Code Duplication*: When code is excessively commented, it can lead to redundancy. Developers may update the code but forget to update the comments, creating a mismatch between code behavior and comments.

-*Maintenance Nightmare*: Over-commented code can become a maintenance nightmare. When you need to make changes, you have to sift through a sea of comments, making it challenging to focus on the actual code logic. 
Keeping a clean codebase is essential for maintainability.

-*False Sense of Security*: Relying too heavily on comments can create a false sense of security. Developers might assume that if something is well-commented, it's well-understood, which is not always the case.

**"TODO" AND "FIXME" COMMENTS**

While most comments should be kept to a minimum, there are two types of comments that serve a distinct purpose and are widely accepted in the developer community:

-*'TODO'*:

A "TODO" is a reminder to address an issue or implement a feature in the code.
It helps developers keep track of pending tasks and ideas.
"TODO" comments ensure that important items are not forgotten and provide context for what needs to be done.
**Example: // TODO: Refactor this function for better performance.**

-*'FIXME'*:

A "FIXME" highlights a problem or bug that needs immediate attention.
It serves as a warning sign for critical issues.
"FIXME" comments help draw attention to parts of the code that require special care.
**Example: // FIXME: Handle edge case when user input is null.**

The best code is not just well-commented; it's code that communicates its intent clearly through its structure and design.
